### Overview 
### Product Vision

FOR college students WHO find keeping track of their academic progress, goals, and four-year plan to be tedious. THE Ribbit mobile application is a productivity and self-care software THAT enables students to document their grades, keep learning streak, and monitor academic goals while tracking assignments. UNLIKE other productivity software that helps students academically, OUR PRODUCT involves a digital frog companion that grows with each goal and assignment completed. Ribbit makes academic progress fun as it provides students with the steps they need to achieve their academic goals.

### Personas
Aadhya: A persona for a sophomore year college student
Andrea, age 19, is a sophomore-year college student at Albion College, a private liberal arts college in Albion, Michigan. She is a psychology major with a minor in philosophy. She is from Lansing, Michigan where her father is an English professor at Lansing Community College and her mother works for the local bank. Apart from academics, Andrea is involved in the Student Volunteering Bureau (SVB), and Art Club and has a tutoring job on campus. Since Andrea attended a part of high school remotely because of the pandemic, she is confident in handling the digital technologies required for education. She believes that the purpose of technology is to make our lives comfortable and efficient and involves technology (smart watches, virtual assistants, smartphones) in her daily life wherever possible. She is interested in using Ribbit which will help her manage multiple tasks, and commitments, meet deadlines, keep track of her academic goals and assignments, and help her stay motivated during her college career.
Temuujin: A Persona for Albion College student 
Jack, 18 years old, is a freshman at Albion College. He was born in Michigan and went to high school there. He likes to play tennis and video games in his free time. Because these two activities take too much time and he just got into college life and schedule, he finds it hard for keeping up with the class schedule and some concepts. To improve in class, he decided to take action. 
First, he went to the study and tutoring sessions which he found little to no use. He also got an Ipad in the hope that it might improve his productivity and his grades. But it was also not really useful. He is interested in using the Ribbit app to remind himself what effort he has to put into which exams and assignments so that he could get the grades he wants with minimal effort. 

Shannon:
Amy, age 20, is a student in her sophomore year at the University of New Mexico. Having grown up in Albuquerque, she has most of her family nearby and feels supported in her education endeavors. As a child, she wanted to be a doctor, however as she progressed in school she found that psychology was the area that interested her the most. Throughout elementary and middle school, Amy often felt separated and disconnected from the rest of her class. Her school psychologist, Mr. Barnes, helped her work through these issues and she was able to get to know classmates she is still friends with to this day. When she graduates, Amy hopes to get a job as a school psychologist to pay it forward. She believes she can utilize her degree to truly make a difference in the world. 
Being a first-generation college student, Amy’s family is proud of her but lacks the guidance and support Amy looks to them for. Recently, Amy has found herself struggling to maintain her grades and get her assignments turned in on time. She has tried a couple of different strategies to avoid this, but she keeps getting distracted when it’s time for her to work. She might use the Ribbit application to keep track of things she has to do and how she is performing in different classes. The digital frog companion may provide Amy with an extra incentive to accomplish her tasks, outside of simply completing them.

Scenarios
Aadhya: Andrea’s scenario: Using Ribbit for improving academically
Andrea is a sophomore majoring in psychology at Albion College. She takes four one-unit classes and two quarter-unit classes. Each class has its own semester schedule. Apart from this, she has a separate work schedule and club meeting times. Every class has different homework deadlines, exam schedules, and grading criteria. Andrea uses the Ribbit tasks feature to note down the assignments, exams, and important meeting times (Student hours, club meetings, group assignments, etc.). The tasks feature sends a remainder 24 hours and one hour before any approaching deadline, scheduled exam, or meeting. This helps Andrea stay on top of her game. However, she was upset after she received her midterm grades because they were lower than she expected. She had a 3.7 GPA in PSYC 207 but she wanted a perfect 4.0.
She met with her professor to ask for tips to improve her grade. Her professor suggested that she can make flashcards and notes in alignment with her daily learning goals and take up
practice questions before the exam. Andrea liked the advice but wanted her professor to
monitor her learning schedule and check her answers to practice questions. Ribbit didn't have
a feature to communicate with professors. But Albion College Course Webs Moodle did.
Andrea requested the administration to link the assignment-sharing feature of Moodle to Ribbit
so that her professor can monitor her learning progress and help her check her answers too.
The administration linked Moodle to Ribbit Extended service that helps students to share
learning progress and non-graded documents with professors. This way professors can know
the student's learning schedules and offer their support in the learning process of students like
Andrea.

Temuujin: Jack’s come-back semester scenario
After finishing his first-ever college semester with undesired grades, he decided to make a change this semester. For this revolution, he decided to use the Ribbit app for scheduling his effort and time. 
To use the app Jack has to collect the syllabus of every class he wants to use the Ribbit app with. Jack puts the information like grade breakdown percentages and due dates for his assignments and exams or he could scan the rubric using his camera. He also needs the grades he wants for each class. For real-time control and information, he has to upload his grades after each exam and assignment to see different ways of succeeding in the class. 

Shannon:
Amy is currently enrolled in PSYC 265: Abnormal Psychology. In the class, Amy learns about different theories of abnormal behavior, as well as various related techniques of diagnosis and therapy. She has gained a broad knowledge on various emotional/behavioral problems such as schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, eating disorders and depressions. Recently, classes at UNM went on spring break, and Amy got a break in her studies to relax and spend time with family and friends. However, upon returning to campus, she finds that the break has thrown her off of her groove and is having difficulty focusing on her assignments and paying attention in class. With summer approaching rapidly, Amy tends to be preoccupied thinking about how she might spend her break and where she might go.
With all of this, Amy is finding it difficult to complete everything on time and is having trouble keeping track of target scores on quizzes and exams in order to keep her grades at a level she is comfortable with. She decides to install the Ribbit app and try it out for a week. Soon, Amy finds that she is completing assignments with ease and can easily see her progress in any class, which is helping her performance. She decides to install the app on her school ipad, in case for some reason she cannot access her phone. However, because this has never happened, she has yet to open the app on the ipad.
On the morning of April 25th, Amy is walking to class when she drops and cracks her phone. Majority of the screen remains intact, but the button to switch between applications no longer works. As a result, all Amy can do with her phone for the time being is respond to incoming text messages and answer calls, until she gets the problem fixed. She cannot open any other apps or utilize the phone in any capacity other than these. After finishing her classes for the day, Amy opens up the Ribbit app on her ipad to input a score for an earlier quiz that day to see how it affects her final grade. However, upon opening the app, Amy is met with a shock. She stares in disbelief as the app launches its default first-use screen. It appears that her progress has not been saved between devices. Amy decides to at least progress past the app tutorial, and start from a clean slate for the time being, when she is suddenly met with a login screen. She recalls that when opening Ribbit on her phone for the first time, she was given a unique username and passcode to access her account, which she saved in an email to herself. Amy gets the login information and successfully logs into her account, and finds that her most recent quiz puts her right on track to earn a 4.0 in PSYC 265.
