## Overview

### Product Vision

FOR college students WHO find keeping track of their academic progress, goals, and four-year plan to be tedious. THE Ribbit mobile application is a productivity and self-care software THAT enables students to document their grades, keep learning streak, and monitor academic goals while tracking assignments. UNLIKE other productivity software that helps students academically, OUR PRODUCT involves a digital frog companion that grows with each goal and assignment completed. Ribbit makes academic progress fun as it provides students with the steps they need to achieve their academic goals.
