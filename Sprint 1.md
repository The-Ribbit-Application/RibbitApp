### Sprint Planning

This sprint’s goal of the first week is to have the screen ideas written out and in order. 
Our goal is also to have the wire frames written out to the group so that we can move forwards with 
the ideas and adjust the story points accordingly. The last goal is to have an official 
architectural layer for our software application and establish feature ideas. On the second week, 
our goals were to assign the feature ideas and start implementing them. The next SCRUM 
master (Temuujin) will keep in touch with each team member on their progress of their 
assigned feature.

### Sprint Review

Our goals for each week were achieved. We were able to keep in touch with one another with our 
tasks on the first week, enabling us to move on to assign features. We wish to have done more 
meetings together to have our timeline of the Ribbit application go smoother and faster. What 
we need to do to improve efficiency is to have more meetings together than just the normal 
partial class time offered.

### Unfinished Items

- Digital frog
- Screen interfaces
- To-do list
- Grade calculator
- Calendar
- Deadline reminder
- Flutter

Each of the team member’s features are still in the work of implementing. We had made 
great progress in the digital frog, screen wiring, and screen interfaces. We will need to
contribute time outside of class to learn the programming language flutter and start 
implementing our features.
